# MovieCompressor
It simply compresses the video by about 95% without serious loss of quality.

It works exactly on version 3.12.9

To get started, you need to install the dependencies:
```
pip install moviepy
```
the current project uses version 2.2.1.

Next, use the command to launch:
```
python video_compressor.py
```

After launching, a folder opens and prompts you to select a video file. 
After selecting the file, the file will be compressed by about 95%. Video with audio is supported. 
After processing is completed, the video will be saved along the path of the original video with the postscript "".
